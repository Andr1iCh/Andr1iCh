# Hi there, I'm Andrii! 👋

I am a Radio Engineering student passionate about Bare-metal C, Low-level Driver Development. My goal is to master the interaction between hardware and software.

---

### 🚀 What I'm working on
Currently, I am developing a **Hardware Abstraction Layer** and **Drivers** from scratch (no HAL/StdPeriph) for STM32 microcontrollers.

#### 🏆 Featured Project: [STM32F411 Driver Library](https://github.com/Andr1iCh/STM32F411_Driver_Library)
A complete bare-metal driver library for STM32F411RE.
* **Core:** Custom GPIO & SPI drivers implementation.
* **Docs:** Full [Doxygen Documentation](https://andr1ich.github.io/STM32F411_Driver_Library/).
